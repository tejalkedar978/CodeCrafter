The rise of e-commerce and online retail platforms has also facilitated wider distribution channels, increasing the market’s reach. Despite challenges such as limited sandalwood cultivation and the sustainability concerns surrounding its production, the market is poised for steady growth due to innovations in cultivation methods and sustainable sourcing practices.</p> <p><a href="#"></a></p> <p>The sandalwood oil market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 8% during the forecast period, with the Asia-Pacific region leading the market, primarily driven by countries like India, Australia, and Indonesia, which are major producers of sandalwood oil.
